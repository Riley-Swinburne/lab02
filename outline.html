        <h3>Aims</h3>
        <p>
            This project-based unit focuses on developing your skills to build web applications
            using web technologies. You'll work individually and in teams to tackle real-world
            web development challenges, building proficiency in selecting and applying suitable
            tools and techniques. The unit also covers essential aspects of security, ethics,
            accessibility, and professional communication within web development. Guidance
            from an academic facilitator will support you in mastering both technical skills and
            collaborative project management techniques to achieve these objectives.
